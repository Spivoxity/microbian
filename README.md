# microbian
The micro:bian embedded OS for BBC micro:bit and other
ARM-based microcontroller boards.

This repository exists primarily to store the full version of
micro:bian, including timeouts and ports to other boards: so that the
version distributed with my book, /Bare Metal micro:bit/, can be
simplified as much as possible.
